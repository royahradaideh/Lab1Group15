Create a new folder (or delete everything inside a folder)



go to the command prompt /terminal there


	example        cd   C:\...\...\...\SEGLab


now before anything, ALWAYS set ur name and email (you only need to do it once
	
	git config --global user.name "Akram"


	git config --global user.email "atassiakram@gmail.com"

now our file is still empty, so lets just clone what we have online into our personal computer

	git clone https://github.com/royahradaideh/Lab1Group15.git

if the top doesn't work, just use the bottom

      git clone https://github.com/royahradaideh/Lab1Group15/blob/main/README.md

	
	we get a new file called Lab1Group15


	lets start initializing git inside this file 


	so type: 
		
		cd Lab1Group15


	then type:
		
		git init


	ur kinda done now, but enjoy yourself by adding a file, changing a file, yadda yadda yadda
	if u do the thing above, once ur done editing type the following 


	git add .
	
	(the . adds everything automatically)
	
	or add the other file directly. Example: you wanna add IH8Life.txt


	git add IH8Life.txt



	then type in the command prompt/terminal:

	git commit -m "    "

	u can put any message:
	for my example:
		git commit -m "Added a new text file"

	then finally type this:

		git push origin main


	if it doesnt work, check ur spelling (Ru'yah is gonna spell "git" as "got" 3 times atleast)


	alternatively, if all ur spelling is correct, try :
		git push origin master
		(depending on how u set up ur download, u either have to use main or master. Main if u followed the tutorial word for word, 
		master if u just downloaded without caring)



	and ur done!!!
